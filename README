NAME
    MooseX::Types::ISO8601 - ISO8601 date and duration string type
    constraints and coercions for Moose

SYNOPSIS
        use MooseX::Types::ISO8601 qw/
            ISO8601TimeDurationStr
        /;

        has duration => (
            isa => ISO8601TimeDurationStr,
            is => 'ro',
            coerce => 1,
        );

        Class->new( duration => 60 ); # 60s => PT00H01M00S
        Class->new( duration => DateTime::Duration->new(%args) )

DESCRIPTION
    This module packages several TypeConstraints with coercions for working
    with ISO8601 date strings and the DateTime suite of objects.

DATE CONSTRAINTS
  ISO8601DateStr
    An ISO8601 date string. E.g. "2009-06-11"

  ISO8601TimeStr
    An ISO8601 time string. E.g. "12:06:34Z"

  ISO8601DateTimeStr
    An ISO8601 combined datetime string. E.g. "2009-06-11T12:06:34Z"

  COERCIONS
    The date types will coerce from:

    " Num "
        The number is treated as a time in seconds since the unix epoch

    " DateTime "
        The duration represented as a DateTime object.

DURATION CONSTRAINTS
  ISO8601DateDurationStr
    An ISO8601 date duration string. E.g. "P01Y01M01D"

  ISO8601TimeDurationStr
    An ISO8601 time duration string. E.g. "PT01H01M01S"

  ISO8601DateTimeDurationStr
    An ISO8601 comboined date and time duration string. E.g.
    "P01Y01M01DT01H01M01S"

  COERCIONS
    The duration types will coerce from:

    " Num "
        The number is treated as a time in seconds

    " DateTime::Duration "
        The duration represented as a DateTime::Duration object.

BUGS
    Probably full of them, patches are very welcome.

    Specifically missing features:

    No timezone support - all times are assumed UTC
    No week number type
    Tests are rubbish.
